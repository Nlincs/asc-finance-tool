      <p>Social care services (unlike health care) are not free for everyone. Most people will have to contribute something towards the cost of their care, with some people having to pay the full cost.</p>
      <p>Use this tool to learn how the council decides whether you qualify for help toward the cost of your care.</p>

      <p>This should take less than 5 minutes.</p>

      <p>If you are looking into care costs on behalf of someone else, like a parent or grandparent, please note that the questions in this tool are about their situation, not yours.</p>
      <p>You will need some idea of the amount of savings and investments held by the person needing care.</p>
