    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Help with paying for your care</h1>
    <p class="govuk-body-l">Based on your answers, you could get help from the council with paying for your care.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Depending on how much your care will cost, you will have to pay for some or all of your care.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The amount you pay is assessed through a "Financial assessment" that will show how much of your income you can afford to contribute, plus an amount between £1 and £36 per week from your savings and investments.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If the cost of your care is less than your assessed contribution, you will pay for all of it. If the cost is more than your assessed contribution, the council will pay the difference.</p>
