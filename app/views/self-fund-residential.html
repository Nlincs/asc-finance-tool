            <p>As a self-funder of care services, you are free to make any arrangements you choose and pay the providers directly.</p>
            <p>If you would like to get some assistance in finding suitable service providers, please contact the Adult Services Access Team on 01724 297000.</p>
            <p>When your savings and investments reduce to below £23,250 you will qualify for financial support. To apply for financial support you will need to complete a Financial Assessment form. We recommend you apply slightly before your capital falls below £23,250 to allow time for your application to be processed.</p>
